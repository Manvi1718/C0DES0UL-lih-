                        With India hosting 10 million weddings annually, there's a substantial food waste issue amounting to about US$14 billion in losses. Roughly 10 to 20 percent of the food served at these events goes to waste. So why not we redirect this excess food to those in need could help mitigate food wastage effectively?
