                    Once you enroll in a text message program, FDC will send you an initial text message. We will ask you to reply "YES" to that message to confirm that you would like to receive text messages from FDC. By replying YES to that message, you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You acknowledge that text messages will be sent to the mobile phone number that you provide to FDC. Such messages may include information about your food rescue program. Once you enroll, the frequency of text message we send to you will vary. You will typically receive text messages when we have information, reminders or updates for you about your food rescue program and/or other information.

                <p>
